# 💤 Sleep Cycle and Productivity Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes the impact of sleep cycles on productivity, stress levels, and sleep quality. It explores key factors such as sleep duration, exercise, caffeine intake, screen time, and work hours.  

### 🔍 Key Features  
✔️ **Linear Regression** - Predicts productivity score based on sleep and lifestyle habits.  
✔️ **Logistic Regression** - Classifies sleep quality (Good/Bad) using sleep hours.  
✔️ **K-Means Clustering** - Groups individuals based on sleep patterns and stress levels.  
✔️ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** - Handles missing values and encodes categorical data.  
✔️ **Visualizations** - Uses Seaborn & Matplotlib for insights.
